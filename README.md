# Project Creater 

Heyho everyone, so I'm pretty new to this Github thing so please have mercy.


Often when you work with visual effects packages like Autodesk Maya or SideFX Houdini
you need some "Project Folder" which is populated with specific folders.

"Project_Creater" lets you build pre-build structures from Maya and Houdini but has also a custom function in which
you can create your own folders with subfolders.

"Project_Creater" is a simple python script I made some time ago.
I noticed that the command-line version is not really useful for me so I've made a quick GUI.
The GUI runs on pyQT and is build with the QT Designer.

I will also upload the python script but it is a bit unoptimised and not ready commented because I have things to do, sorry.

I've found it really useful when working on quick or test projects and that is why I'm publishing it.
I'm going to add new setups in the future and if anyone wants to see a specific setup just contact me or 
edit it into the code yourself.

If anybody is using this thing just say how you like it and if it works for you.

## Setup

If you just need the executable download it from the "executable" directory above.
For now there is only a MacOSX version, this will be corrected shortly.

If you want to work with the script just use ```pip3 install PyQT5```
and download the Project_Creater.py and extras.py.
